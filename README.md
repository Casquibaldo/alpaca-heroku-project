# alpaca-heroku-project
Trying out the Alpaca trading API on a Heroku server

First I'll be using a slightly altered demo I found on https://alpaca.markets/learn/python-aws-trading-algorithm/ but I won't be using AWS for now (some sort of discrepancy with the card...)
Let's see how this project evolves.

# New ideas to try out:
1. SSH into Heroku server
2. Multiple strategies (as per https://alpaca.markets/learn/alpaca-proxy-agent-01/)
3. Get updates about positions.
